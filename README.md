# Jeremiah Bogard

## A Frontend and Backend Web Developer

---

Hi my name is Jeremiah, I am a **Self-Taught** Web Developer specializing in the **Frontend and Backend**. I first started my programming journey in 2018 on a Non-Profit platform known as [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org). Shortly after completing all the courses they had at the time, I moved to watching [YouTube Videos](https://youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified)[^1]. By utilizing this free platform, I was able to scale my knowledge of programming to a new level.
